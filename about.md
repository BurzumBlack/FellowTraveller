### **Who is the Fellow Traveller**<br>
Fellow Traveller is not the singular of [Fellow Travellers the 2023 series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15384586/), nor the [Wikipedia definition of Fellow Traveller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_traveller).

Fellow Traveller is someone who is sympathetic to an idea, discipline, or a political organization, without being a member of the set of people who are normally associated with this idea, discipline, or a political organization.

A fellow traveler can research in Computer Science; but is not a Computer Scientist. Philosophize; but is not a philosopher. Appreciate the beauty and elegance of Mathematics; but is not a Mathematician. Listen to Black Metal; but is not a metalhead. In short a Fellow Traveller is an amateur in the true sense of the word. 
> The word amateur derives from the Latin word amator, which means lover, devoted friend, or someone who is in avid pursuit of an objective. In the original sense, an amateur is someone who does something for the love of it. Amateurs do what they do because they have a passion for it, not because it pays the bills. - Sir Ken Robinson, The Element
